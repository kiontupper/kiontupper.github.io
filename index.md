I have been developing software for 10 years, starting with primative web experiments. I have used several languages across many domains.

Some languages I have used, in order from favorite to least favorite, include:

1. Swift
2. TypeScript
3. Lua
4. Haxe
5. JavaScript
6. HTML/CSS

<small>(And the not-so-favorites...)</small>

7. Java
8. Python

I've used these languages in a variety of applications from front-end applications to back-end servers to embedded robotics controllers.

## Current Projects

I'm currently working on a proprietary messaging app with end-to-end encryption for maximal privacy. End-to-end encryption by itself isn't all that special, but Antem is the only app to my knowledge that will provide encryption for enterprise communication and productivity, as well as group chats, and accessibility from the web. All private messages are automatically encrypted, even for groups and organizations. An overview is available at [antem.app](https://antem.app).
